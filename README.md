# Thermistor-Temperature-Monitor

This project is an Arduino-based temperature monitoring system thermistor. It measures temperature and displays the values in both Celsius and Fahrenheit on a 16x2 LCD. The temperature readings are also sent to the Serial Monitor for real-time tracking. It requires an Arduino board, a thermistor, a 10kÎ© reference resistor, and an I2C LCD module.
